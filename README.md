# React Tac Toe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

After completing the fun little Tic Tac Toe tutorial over at [ReactJS.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html),
figured the best way to find out if I actually learned anything was to try and code it again from scratch without
referencing the tutorial page.

And this was the result! The code deviates pretty wildly from the original tutorial because obviously there is more than one way
to slice an apple, but the end result is a fully functional Tic Tac Toe app (with history!) built in ReactJS.
